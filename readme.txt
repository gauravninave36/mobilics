I have created two folder for frontend and backend.
Backend is on nodejs library express.js and with rest api approach i have used.
For running backend just cd into folder backend folder and pull on terminal with cd in same folder 
if you have nodemon then you can use command "nodemon server.js" to start server on localhost:4000
or you can use "node server.js" for running backend on localhost:4000

For frontend is created on react.js and you cd into the frontend folder and pull on terminal with cd 
same folder and run command "npm start" to run front end on localhost:3000.I have used mongodb for 
database too.
